       The periodic table, also known as the periodic table of (the) (chemical) elements, 
       is a tabular display of the chemical elements. It is widely used 
       in chemistry, physics, and other sciences, and is generally seen as an icon of chemistry. 
       It is a graphic formulation of the periodic law, which states that the properties of the 
       chemical elements exhibit a periodic dependence on their
        atomic numbers.</p>  

  <p class="d">The table is divided into four roughly rectangular areas called blocks
    . The rows of the table are called periods,
 and the columns are called groups. Elements from the same column group of
  the periodic
  table show similar 
 chemical characteristics. Trends run through the periodic table, with non-metallic
  character (keeping their own electrons)
  increasing from left to right across a period, and from down to up across a group,
   and metallic character 
  (surrendering electrons to other atoms) increasing in the opposite direction
  . The underlying reason for these trends
   is electron configurations of atom.The modern pedrodic 
   table was inverted
    by scientist moseley by aranging
        the atomic number and the mass number. he was the succersor of the
        mendeleev.the modern perodic table has even more limitation
        . he seprated
        the f block elements and not added in 6th and 7th period
        . by its the
        only acceptble one so every one agreed it. he was also used the
        electronic configuration for this. lest check the
         properties of it</

    <p class="t">befor the moseley many scientist like dobneriar and newland tryed 
      arange the elements in the perodic manner but they have more limitation and it can't 
      apply after the metal calcium</p>
